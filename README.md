# Flipkart-CSAT-Score-Analysis-Project
This project focuses on analyzing customer support data to understand the key factors influencing customer satisfaction (CSAT) and overall service performance. The primary objective was to identify patterns in customer complaints and examine how different variables such as complaint category, sub-category, support channel, agent tenure, and customer location impact satisfaction levels. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python to handle inconsistencies, remove unnecessary spaces in column names, and manage missing values before conducting the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using Pandas and Matplotlib to uncover trends and relationships within the data. Various visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, and density plots, were used to examine complaint distribution and CSAT score patterns. The analysis revealed that certain complaint categories, particularly order-related and return-related issues, contributed significantly to overall complaint volume and had a noticeable effect on customer satisfaction scores. Additionally, comparisons across support channels and agent experience levels provided insights into operational efficiency and service quality.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, statistical reasoning, data visualization, and business insight generation. By identifying major drivers of dissatisfaction and highlighting areas that require operational improvement, the analysis provides actionable recommendations to enhance customer experience and optimize support performance. Overall, this project reflects the application of data analytics techniques to solve real-world business problems and support data-driven decision-making.
